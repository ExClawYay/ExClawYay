## What's cooking?
- 🧪 Little experiments in automation and UI design
- 🔧 Tools I tinker with: Python, Node, and random shell sorcery
- 🎨 A soft spot for clean, shiny interfaces and quirky micro-interactions

---

## Featured vibes
- **Curiosity-first**: I build things to learn fast — prototypes, demos, and sometimes glorious failures.
- **UX matters**: If it doesn't feel delightful, it doesn't ship (or at least it gets a sticker).
- **Automation is peace**: Repetitive tasks deserve to be automated and then celebrated.

## Favorite things
- Coffee ☕ + late-night debugging
- Crafting tiny animations that make people smile
